    "title": "BIO",
    "bio": "I love fashion, it's part of my life. Fashion is design but fashion is also communication. It must reach all audiences, so you need to understand it and know how to explain it. That's why I have studied fashion events management, protocol, institutional relations, communication, and marketing.",
    "bio2": "Stylist is my next goal. I have worked in London and Barcelona, two cities that have inspired me because fashion is everywhere. I like to create stories around fashion, as big brands do by creating storytelling that they know how to convey in their shows. For now I admire them, my dream is to get to do it myself someday.",
